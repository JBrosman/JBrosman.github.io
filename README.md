# Jbrosman.github.io
This is the portfolio page for Jeff Brosman, and will be a place to learn more about Jeff and showcase examples of his coding work.

<h4>To Use this site</h4>
The site should be easy to use. Click the play icon on the YouTube video to see a quick introduction. Click the buttons at the top right of the screen to see contact information or go to the projects page.

<h4>Future RoadMap</h4>
Many more projects will be posted here, and the page format itself will continue to be modified. The page needs additional programing added to help viewability on different sizes of screens.
